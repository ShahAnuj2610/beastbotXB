Hello;
This repo is the job of comparing, viewing, adding, removing code from other strategies and finally adding your own code according to conditions, technical analysis, and many hyperopts.

I have added 2 versions, one with more risk and one with less, and the results obtained in the last 2 months with a bearish and unfavorable market.

gracias
